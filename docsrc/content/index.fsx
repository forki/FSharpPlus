Example 2
---------

This example demonstrates using a generic function defined in this library.

*)

map string [|2;3;4;5|]
// val it : string [] = [|"2"; "3"; "4"; "5"|]

map ((+) 9) (Some 3)
// val it : int option = Some 12

open FSharpPlus.Data

map string (NonEmptyList.create 2 [3;4;5])
// val it : NonEmptyList<string> = {Head = "2"; Tail = ["3"; "4"; "5"];}
