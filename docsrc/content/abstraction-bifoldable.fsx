Bifoldable
=======

Intuitively a bifoldable is a type with 2 arguments, each of them being foldable.

___

A bifoldable (short for binary foldable) or foldable of two variables is a container of up to two elements whose components can be folded to a single value.

Unlike bimap which preserves the container type, bifoldable will extract and fold the value.


Minimal complete definition
---------------------------


 * ``bifoldMap f g x``
*)
(**
    static member BifoldMap (x:'Bifoldable<'T,'V>, f:'T->'U, g:'V->'U) :'U
*)
(**

* ``bifoldBack f g z x``
*)
(**
    static member BifoldBack (x:'Bifoldable<'T,'V>, f:'T->'Monoid, g:'V->'Monoid, z: 'Monoid) :'Monoid
*)
(**


Other operations
----------------

 * ``bisum x``
*)
(**
    static member Bisum (x:Bifunctor<'T,'T>) :'T
*)

Rules

    bisum x = bifoldMap id id x

Related Abstractions
--------------------

 - [Foldable](abstraction-foldable.html): All bifoldable contain up to two elements that are foldable to a single common type.
 - [Monoid](abstraction-monoid.html): For containers where the two elements are not disjoint, the same relation that foldable has to monoid applies.

Concrete implementations
------------------------

From .Net/F#
 
 -  ``'T * 'U``
 -  ``Result<'T,'U>``
 -  ``Choice<'T,'U>``

 
From F#+

 -  ``Const<'C,'T>``
 -  ``Validation<'err,'a>``

// implementing on custom type:

    | MyLeft of 'a 
    | MyRight of 'b

type MyEither<'a,'b> with
    static member inline BifoldMap (x: MyEither<_,_>, f, g) =
      match x with

      | MyRight a -> g a

    static member BifoldBack (x: MyEither<_,_>, f, g, z) =
        match x with
        | MyLeft a -> f a z
        | MyRight a -> g a z

bisum (MyEither.MyLeft "a") // = "a"
