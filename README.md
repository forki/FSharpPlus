F#+ is a base library that aims to take F# to the next level of functional
programming.

*What if we imagine F# as more than it is?*

F#+ builds upon FSharp, using generic programming techniques to help
you avoid boiler plate code.  However, by naming conventions and signatures
it can be seen to 'enhance' rather than 'replace' existing patterns as much
as possible.

Getting started is easy since you can start with enjoying some of the extensions
and generic functions, but you will find other parts of F#+ unfold before you
and become useful the deeper in you get.

See the [documentation](//fsprojects.github.io/FSharpPlus) for more details.
